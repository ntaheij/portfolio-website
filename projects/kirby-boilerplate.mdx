## Why did I make this?
During my internship at [MrBoost](https://mrboost.nl), I found out about [Kirby's](https://getkirby.com/) existence. A flat-file based CMS, which allows you to build easy-to-manage sites for the end user. Since I immediately became enthusiastic about this and could estimate that I would use this tool more often, I decided to create a boilerplate (I saw that these did not yet exist) to use as a basis for every Kirby project.

## My boilerplate
The boilerplate is built on several techniques, which can be used directly within the corresponding files:

- BarbaJS
- Twig
- KirbyCMS
- Vite
- GSAP
- PostCSS
