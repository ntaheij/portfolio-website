## What is Codebin?
I felt like Hastebin didn't comply with my needs. It doesn't store your bins in an overview, it cannot be privated and is easily crawlable. Codebin uses all the lacking features, and continues to rise with new ones.

## Tech stack
I used several techniques to build this site:

- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
- NodeJS
